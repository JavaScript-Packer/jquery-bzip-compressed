# jquery-bzip-compressed
These are the smallest possible JQuery files (full featured, nothing removed) on the planet Earth. They are compressed with bzip (setting at 9) and include a client side unpacker/decompressor/extractor. These were compiled/generated/created using online tool http://www.whak.ca/packer/!
If I missed any popular releases, let me know :)
